// BetterRest: Introduction
/*
 - All iphones come with a technology called 'Core ML' built right in, which allows you to write code that makes predictions about new data based on previous data it has seen.
 
 - The actual app we're building is called BetterRest, and it's designed to help coffee drinkers get a good night's sleep by asking them 3 questions
 
 1. When do they want to wake up?
 2. Roughly how many hours of sleep do they want?
 3. How many cups of coffee do they drink per day?
 
 Once we have those 3 values we'll feed them into Core ML to get a result telling us when they ought to go to bed
